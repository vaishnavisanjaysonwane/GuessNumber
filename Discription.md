Guess number code
In this code i have used funtion i.e. math.random() this method return float number randomly in between 0 to 1 
if user number and random number which is casted in int matches then user wins if not matches then they'll have 4-5 chances continuosly.
and every time code will tell user number is greater or smaller which is predicated by user.
